# Altered Draft Simulator — Roadmap

Working notes for upcoming work, kept in the repo so it's available from any machine.
See `CLAUDE.md` for full project/architecture context.

Context (June 2026): the site was shared on the Altered Discord and got a strong reception.
Equinox (the publisher) is winding down; **Re:Union / Altered Reunion** is the official
community project keeping Altered alive — and its dev reached out to integrate. The two
forces shaping this roadmap are (1) building toward that Re:Union integration and (2) a
closing window on the old `api.altered.gg` card/unique API before it's retired.

---

## Now — active priorities (in order)

### 1. Re:Union (Altered Reunion) account integration — NEW, blocked on dev deliverables
Connect the app to the **official Re:Union identity** so logged-in users can push their
drafted deck straight into their account. This does NOT mean building our own accounts
(see Dropped) — Re:Union owns the identity layer (Keycloak), DB, and auth; we're a client.
Strictly **optional and additive**: anonymous use (paste cubes, localStorage decks, file
export) is unchanged; "Connect Re:Union" just unlocks extras for those who opt in.

**Auth setup (provided by the Re:Union dev):**
- Protocol: **OpenID Connect** via **Keycloak**.
- Issuer / base: `https://auth.altered.re/`, realm `players`
  (discovery: `https://auth.altered.re/realms/players/.well-known/openid-configuration`).
- `clientId`: `altered-draft`. **Confidential client** (a client secret exists).
- **Client secret is NEVER in git / never in the browser bundle / never pasted into chat or repo.**

**Decided architecture — confidential client + one Vercel Serverless Function:**
- The app is a frontend-only static SPA, so the secret can't live client-side. A single
  stateless Vercel function (e.g. `/api/token`) holds the secret as a **Vercel env var**
  (`KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`) and performs the `code → token` exchange (+ refresh). Still no
  database, still no real backend — just one function. (Public-client+PKCE was the
  alternative; we chose to keep his confidential client and add the function.)
- Use **Authorization Code + PKCE** on top (defense in depth; Keycloak supports both).
- Flow: SPA redirects to Keycloak → user logs in → back to `/auth/callback?code=…` →
  SPA POSTs the code to `/api/token` → function exchanges it (with the secret) → returns the
  user's access/refresh tokens → SPA calls the Re:Union **decks API** with the user's Bearer token.
- Public OIDC config (issuer, realm, clientId) can be plain constants / `VITE_` vars; only the
  secret is server-side.

**Blocked on the Re:Union dev:**
- Register **redirect URIs** for BOTH local and prod (we test on both):
  `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`, `https://altered-draft.vercel.app/auth/callback`,
  post-logout `http://localhost:5173/` + `https://altered-draft.vercel.app/`,
  and web-origins (CORS) for both.
- Provide the **decks API**: base URL, the create-deck endpoint, payload format, and the
  **scope/audience** the user's access token needs.

**Feature tiers (each maps to a Keycloak/API scope — ask for these, ship in this order):**
- 🟢 **`deck:write`** — one-click "Save deck to my Re:Union account" at the end of a
  draft/sealed; optionally save the whole pool as a deck. *Smallest, most-requested, highest
  delight — ship first.*
- 🟢 **`deck:read`** — build a custom cube/pool from one of your account decks (solves the
  recurring "how do I import decks?" ask without a separate parser).
- 🟡 **`collection:read`** — "draft from my collection", owned/not-owned overlay during the
  draft, post-draft "missing cards" report, auto-build a cube from your collection.
- 🟡 **`profile:read`** — persistent name/avatar (no retyping each room), account-based rejoin
  across devices, draft history, optional authenticated rooms.
- 🔴 **card-data API (strategic)** — if Re:Union exposes card + unique data, it can replace the
  dying `api.altered.gg` and largely dissolve priority #2 below. Uncertain — treat #2 as a hedge.

### 2. Bundle more uniques locally — data source FOUND, art still time-sensitive
Today only **24 cube uniques** are bundled (`src/lib/uniquesData.js` `UNIQUES_EN` + images in
`public/uniques/<ref>.jpg`); any other unique resolves *only while a live API is up*, then is
dropped (surfaced in the "unresolved refs" callout). Multiple community members want
**unique-heavy cubes** (CptKawaii's "cube unique", wordcandy70's "Uniques Cube") — exactly the
at-risk case.

**New durable data source (tested June 2026):** `api.altered.gg` is being retired, but the
community site **`cards.alteredcore.org`** serves the same data and should outlive it.
- **Endpoint:** `https://cards.alteredcore.org/api/cards?reference=<REF>` (Symfony / API
  Platform; no auth). Returns `{ member: [<card>], totalItems }`. The single-id path
  (`/api/cards/<ref>`) 500s — always use the `?reference=` filter.
- **Verified:** all 24 bundled uniques **+** an arbitrary new ref (`ALT_CORE_B_AX_16_U_5075`)
  resolve with full data, and `faction.code` matches our hardcoded factions exactly — including
  every out-of-faction case (e.g. `..._AX_16_U_...` → Bravos, `..._BR_19_...` → Lyra). So this
  source can snapshot **any** unique, not just our 24, even after the old API dies.
- **Different JSON shape** than the old API (needs its own adapter, NOT `normalizeCard`):
  `name` / `imagePath` / `cardType.name` are **per-locale objects** (use `.en`); faction is
  `faction.code` + `faction.name`; `rarity.reference`; `cardType.reference`; and **flat integer**
  `mainCost` / `recallCost` / `forestPower` / `mountainPower` / `oceanPower` (no `#...#` markers).
- **⚠️ Image gotcha:** the API's `imagePath.en` points at the **locked** `altered-dev.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com`
  bucket (403 AccessDenied, even with UA/referer). The **same file is public on the prod bucket** —
  swap the host to **`altered-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com`** (path + filename hash identical) → 200
  JPEG. (The old `api.altered.gg` also still returns the prod URL directly while it's up.)

**Action (snapshot script, when refs are in hand — no code yet):** for each unique ref, GET
`cards.alteredcore.org/api/cards?reference=<ref>`, map the fields above into a `UNIQUES_EN`
entry, and download the art from the **prod**-bucket URL (host-swap the returned `imagePath.en`)
to `public/uniques/<ref>.jpg`. Commit the script this time (the original wasn't committed).
Prioritise refs from the community cubes people are actually pasting. Needs Node → run on macOS
(not on PATH on Windows).
- **Urgency reassessed:** card **data** is now future-proofed by `cards.alteredcore.org`, so this
  is no longer a hard deadline for metadata. **Art still depends on the prod S3 bucket staying
  public** — so grabbing images sooner is the remaining time-sensitive part. May later be
  superseded if Re:Union ships its own card-data + image API (1🔴), but that's not guaranteed.
- Possible enhancement: accept a pasted list of unique refs and snapshot them on demand.

### 3. Import Marcus' cube (data-only) — ACTIVE, blocked on the full card list
A cube by a game designer (MarcusK, engaged on Discord). Add it the manual way, like LuigiNico's.
- **Blocker:** the current list is **missing a few cards** — author is completing it. Don't
  finalise `refs[]`/`cardCount` until the full list lands.
- Add an object to `COMMUNITY_CUBES` in `src/lib/cubes.js` (`id, name, author, description,
  cardCount, refs[]`, plus `heroDraft`/`heroes`/`booster`/`maxPlayers` if it applies).
- Convert official identifiers (e.g. `BTG-131-U-894`) to internal refs
  `ALT_<SET>_B_<FAC>_<n>_<rarity>`. Out-of-faction cards use their real `_R2` ref (see the OOF
  note in `CLAUDE.md`); uniques stay as-is.
- If it has uniques, bundle them (see #2 — same script) while the API is up.
- Add a `booster` recipe (`{ commons, rares, uniques }`) if the rarity mix can't use the classic
  split — see `generateCubeRecipePacks` in `src/lib/packGenerator.js`.
- **Heroes:** has 12 heroes → set `heroDraft: true` + `heroes:[…12 refs]`; the in-app hero draft
  (shipped) handles it. Cap `maxPlayers` to what the pool supports (LuigiNico = 4 because 192 = 4×4×12).
- Source CSV parsed so far: 12 heroes + 367 cards across **all 6 factions** (Ordis + Yzmir
  included, no faction relabel needed); rarities C / R / O (off-faction) / U. Uncertain entries
  still need author input or substitution (no live API): `Halua (unique ?)`, `Nike Unique à 6`,
  `Spotter Unique`, `Jumper R ?`, `Sakarabru?`, blank-rarity `Wingsuit Jumper` — plus the
  not-yet-listed missing cards.

## Planned

### Community / Spotlight cubes (rotating)
wordcandy70 & Kari (Casual Alterations) want to put up a **rotating monthly community cube**
(first: All Commons; others: a Uniques Cube, "Opps All Jellyfish", "Six Sets, Six Factions").
User likes the rotating-spotlight idea.
- **Option A (zero code):** they keep pasting their cube each month; signal-boost on Discord.
- **Option B (a feature):** a curated "Spotlight / Community cubes" section in the Cubes tab —
  add their cubes to `COMMUNITY_CUBES` like LuigiNico's, marked as featured/rotating.
- Note: a Uniques Cube depends hard on priority #2 (bundling uniques) to keep working.

### Deck import (decklist → pool/cube)
Recurring ask ("now have to figure how to import decks"). Pull a decklist INTO the site as a
sealed pool or a cube. We already parse the Export format (`parseDecklist` in
`src/lib/cubeParser.js`), so a standalone "import a decklist as a pool" is cheap. Overlaps with
Re:Union `deck:read` (1🟢) — decide whether to do the simple paste version now or fold it into
the Re:Union work.

### Winston draft (new 2-player mode)
A take-or-pass format, great for 2-player cube play.
- Mechanics: shuffle the pool into a main stack; keep 3 face-down piles. On your turn, look at
  pile 1 → **take it** (refill that pile from the main stack) or **pass** (drop the top of the
  main stack onto that pile, move to the next). Pass all 3 → take the blind top card of the main
  stack. Continue until the stack is empty. 2 players only.
- Needs its own draft mode/phase + state (main stack, the 3 piles, whose turn) synced via
  `draft_rooms` + realtime, and its own UI (not the `CardGrid` pack view). Pure transitions in
  `src/lib/draftLogic.js`, seeded by a `buildInitialState`-style helper. Works naturally with a
  cube's single shuffled pool.

### LuigiNico's newest cube (set 1–5) — PARKED by choice
Author shared a now-public [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a3ZZ2AzzPp05rWJq9Mzt6torBro4noEC74Pn27KXxX0/edit?gid=0)
with tag-column notes, but it's **missing some uniques** ("add any six you feel like") and a bit
out of date. **Parked until set 6 is playable on BGA** (user's call). This is a DIFFERENT, newer
cube than the LuigiNico cube already in the app.

### Open-source under Altered-Community — eventually, not yet
The Re:Union dev offered to host the project open-source (with a license) on the official
[Altered-Community](https://github.com/Altered-Community) GitHub org. **Decision: move later, not
immediately** — get the Re:Union integration working first, then migrate. Before any public push:
(1) choose a license, (2) **scan the full git history to confirm no secret was ever committed**
(the Supabase publishable/anon key is fine; verify no secret key, no `.env`, no Keycloak secret).

## Recently shipped

- **Cube sealed booster labels fixed** (June 2026). Cube sealed packs are multiset, but the
  booster header labeled each by its first card's set (e.g. "Booster 2 · Skybound Odyssey 1/1").
  Now cube rooms (built-in or pasted) show the cube name, no set icon/ordinal; Multi-Set/Chaos
  sealed (genuinely single-set) unchanged. (`src/pages/Sealed.jsx`)
- **Usage monitoring** (June 2026). `draft_rooms` self-purges hourly (pg_cron `cleanup-old-rooms`,
  >24h), so a `room_stats(day, rooms_created)` table is tallied by the cron BEFORE the delete for
  permanent history. Snapshot + history queries documented in `supabase-monitoring.sql`.
- **Personal cubes via paste**. NO accounts / storage. Cubes tab "＋ Paste your own cube" panel
  (name + `<qty> <REF>` decklist). `parseDecklist` (`src/lib/cubeParser.js`) → refs with
  quantities (refs-only). On Parse: refs resolved against set data + bundled uniques, **heroes
  auto-detected** and split out, duplicates kept, **unresolved refs surfaced** (callout) and
  skipped. Carried inline as `config.customCube = { name, cards:[refs], heroes:[refs] }`, synced
  via Realtime. **Draft:** `generateCubeDraftPacks` on the non-hero multiset; heroes use the
  shared-pool snake draft when `uniqueHeroes ≥ players`, else fold into packs. **Sealed:** heroes
  stay in pool, 7 multiset boosters/player. Player cap auto-derived. Mutually exclusive with
  built-in cube selection. `Draft.jsx`/`Results.jsx`/`Sealed.jsx` resolve uniques from `customCube`.
- **Merged "Multi-Set" draft tab**. Advanced + Chaos → ONE draft tab with "All players receive the
  same packs" (default ON, `config.equalPacks`). One per-set selector (`MultiSetSelector.jsx`);
  required total follows the toggle: **ON → per-player, sum = 4**; **OFF → whole bag, sum =
  players × 4**. Both deal single-set boosters: ON → `generateStructuredPacks` (same set per round
  for all seats); OFF → `generateChaosPacks` (shuffled bag). Stored as `config.multiSetMix` +
  `config.equalPacks`. DRAFT only — sealed keeps its Advanced tab. Removed `ChaosSelector.jsx` +
  `config.chaosMix`.
- **In-app hero draft**. For `heroDraft` cubes, heroes are snake-drafted from ONE shared pool
  (`cube.heroes`): one hero per player after each card round, until each has `min(3,
  floor(pool/players))` → 3 at 2–4 players, 2 at 5–6. `applyPick` pauses into `heroDraft` after
  each round; `applyHeroPick` resumes. Drafted heroes merge into each seat's Results pool.
  `Draft.jsx` phase-aware. Used by LuigiNico (12 heroes, maxPlayers 4) and the All Sets cube
  (12 heroes, 324 cards, maxPlayers 6).

## Candidate / backlog (ideas from other drafting sites)
- **Draft log & replay** — record each seat's picks *and* passes; review after the draft.
- **Cube analytics** — extend `CubePreviewModal` with curve / faction-balance / rarity stats.
- Lower priority: Grid draft, Rochester, Rotisserie alternate formats.

## Waiting on assets
- FUGUE logo, Exalted gem (currently fall back to text / reuse the rare gem).

## Dropped (do not implement)
- **Homegrown accounts / login / user database** — still dropped. We do NOT build our own auth.
  NOTE: integrating with **Re:Union's official Keycloak OIDC** is a different thing and IS in scope
  (Now #1) — identity, DB and auth live on Re:Union's side; we only hold the client secret in a
  Vercel env var and call their API with the user's token. Personal cube *sharing* stays paste-based.
- Bot players; asymmetric pack distribution (superseded by Multi-Set/Chaos); spectator mode; card
  flagging (built then reverted — not wanted).
