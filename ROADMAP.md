# Altered Draft Simulator — Roadmap

Working notes for upcoming work, kept in the repo so it's available from any machine.
See `CLAUDE.md` for full project/architecture context.

Context (June 2026): the site was shared on the Altered Discord and got a strong reception.
Equinox (the publisher) is winding down; **Re:Union / Altered Reunion** is the official
community project keeping Altered alive — and its dev reached out to integrate. The two
forces shaping this roadmap are (1) building toward that Re:Union integration and (2) a
closing window on the old `api.altered.gg` card/unique API before it's retired.

---

## Now — active priorities (in order)

### 1. Re:Union (Altered Reunion) account integration — NEW, blocked on dev deliverables
Connect the app to the **official Re:Union identity** so logged-in users can push their
drafted deck straight into their account. This does NOT mean building our own accounts
(see Dropped) — Re:Union owns the identity layer (Keycloak), DB, and auth; we're a client.
Strictly **optional and additive**: anonymous use (paste cubes, localStorage decks, file
export) is unchanged; "Connect Re:Union" just unlocks extras for those who opt in.

**✅ Auth FOUNDATION shipped (June 2026):** login/logout works in code — `api/token.js`
(serverless code↔token exchange), `src/lib/reunion.js` (PKCE OIDC client), `AuthProvider` +
`useAuth()`, `/auth/callback` route, `ReunionButton` on Home. Deployed and **verified live end-to-end**: a real user logged in (redirect URIs registered by the
dev) and their pseudo renders — the full Connect → Keycloak → callback → token exchange (function +
`KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`) → userinfo flow works.

**✅ Step 2 (deck read/write) shipped (June 2026) — pending live user test.** Both features built +
deployed; the proxy layer is verified live (no-auth → our 401; bogus token → upstream's 401, proving
forwarding). Decks API `https://decks.alteredcore.org` via same-origin Vercel proxies
(`api/decks/index.js` GET list/POST create, `api/decks/[id].js` GET detail) forwarding the Bearer token
(no browser CORS). **Load a cube from your decks** (Lobby Cubes tab) and **save pool + final deck**
(one `ExportMenu` dropdown on Results/Sealed). Shared `resolveCubeRefs` (`src/lib/cubeResolve.js`) turns
deck cards into a cube like paste. **UX pass shipped (17 Jun 2026)** after first live testing: deck picker
now fetches the WHOLE list (`itemsPerPage=1000&order[name]=asc`) with a name-search box + format-filter
chips + a Preview-cube button; the 4 export/save buttons collapsed into one **Export / Save** dropdown
(copy card list, copy decklist, save pulls, save deck); saves use **`format:'sandbox'`** and are named
`"<code> · <Draft|Sealed> <pool|deck> · DDMM"`. Decks-API contract (format enum, query filters) confirmed
from the live OpenAPI `https://decks.alteredcore.org/api/docs.json`. **Still watch on live save:** (a) a 403
→ add a deck scope to `SCOPES` in `reunion.js`; (b) a sandbox pool/deck rejected → surface the API error
(the dropdown shows "failed" with the message). **Not feasible:** a deck-size (≥80 cards) picker filter —
the list endpoint returns no card count (only the per-deck detail does).
_Hardening fast-follow: move the refresh token to an httpOnly cookie._

**Auth setup (provided by the Re:Union dev):**
- Protocol: **OpenID Connect** via **Keycloak**.
- Issuer / base: `https://auth.altered.re/`, realm `players`
  (discovery: `https://auth.altered.re/realms/players/.well-known/openid-configuration`).
- `clientId`: `altered-draft`. **Confidential client** (a client secret exists).
- **Client secret is NEVER in git / never in the browser bundle / never pasted into chat or repo.**

**Decided architecture — confidential client + one Vercel Serverless Function:**
- The app is a frontend-only static SPA, so the secret can't live client-side. A single
  stateless Vercel function (e.g. `/api/token`) holds the secret as a **Vercel env var**
  (`KEYCLOAK_CLIENT_SECRET`) and performs the `code → token` exchange (+ refresh). Still no
  database, still no real backend — just one function. (Public-client+PKCE was the
  alternative; we chose to keep his confidential client and add the function.)
- Use **Authorization Code + PKCE** on top (defense in depth; Keycloak supports both).
- Flow: SPA redirects to Keycloak → user logs in → back to `/auth/callback?code=…` →
  SPA POSTs the code to `/api/token` → function exchanges it (with the secret) → returns the
  user's access/refresh tokens → SPA calls the Re:Union **decks API** with the user's Bearer token.
- Public OIDC config (issuer, realm, clientId) can be plain constants / `VITE_` vars; only the
  secret is server-side.

**Local dev environment — DROPPED (user's call).** `github.com/Altered-Community/altered-dev-environment`
(a .NET Aspire stack running the whole Re:Union backend locally) exists, but with `collection`/`profile`
scopes dropped and deck read/write already shipped + verified on prod, there's nothing left that needs
it. Verify-on-deploy is sufficient. Kept below for reference only if a future scope ever revives the need:
- **Keycloak** (realm `players`) at `http://auth.altered.local.gd:18080`, admin `admin`/`admin`;
  test users `alice`/`bob` (pw `TestPassword1234`). `*.local.gd` → 127.0.0.1 (no hosts-file edit).
- **decks-api** at `http://localhost:8001` (the deck-write target); **collection-api** OpenAPI at
  `http://localhost:8002/api/docs`. Read the deck contract straight from the running API.
- Register our own **confidential `altered-draft`** client via the realm seed
  `AlteredAuth/dev/clean.js` (then restart `altered-auth`): redirect `http://localhost:5173/auth/callback`,
  web-origin `http://localhost:5173`; copy its secret. `DEV_AUTH_ENABLED` (HS256 `iss:dev`) shortcut
  exists for testing deck-writes without the full login.
- Confirms our architecture: the decks-api "uses a confidential client requiring consent."
- Prereqs (ALL on one machine — `*.local.gd` is 127.0.0.1): Docker, .NET 10 SDK, Aspire CLI, plus
  Node + Vercel CLI for our `vercel dev` side. Run `./run.ps1` / `./run.sh`.
- **Setup deferred — not started (user's call).** This Windows box has only `git` on PATH; macOS
  already has Node, likely the lighter lift.

**Decks API contract — FOUND in `github.com/Altered-Community/alteredcore-website`**
(the `equinox-deck-import` plugin's `CurlDeckApiClient.php` + `Domain/{Card,Deck}.php`):
- Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <user access token>` + `Accept: application/json`.
- **List my decks:** `GET {base}/api/decks` → array (or `{items|decks|data:[...]}` wrapper).
- **Deck detail (with cards):** `GET {base}/api/decks/{id}` → full deck incl. `deckCards`.
- **Create:** `POST {base}/api/decks` JSON `{ name, format:"standard", isPublic:false, isDraft:false,
  deckCards:[{cardReference:"ALT_…", quantity:1-99}] }` → 2xx `{ id }`. Hero = just a 1-of entry in
  `deckCards`. Card ref must match `^ALT_[A-Z0-9_]+$` (uppercase).
- Maps cleanly to both objectives: load-cube = GET list → GET {id} → expand `deckCards`; save =
  POST twice (pool + final deck).

**Resolved by probing (step 2 now effectively unblocked):**
- **Prod base URL = `https://decks.alteredcore.org`** ✅ (`GET /api/decks` → 401
  `application/problem+json` "Full authentication is required"; Symfony API behind Cloudflare).
- **CORS → MUST proxy** ✅ — preflight returns allow-methods/headers but **no `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`**
  for our origin, so direct browser calls are blocked. Route decks calls through **Vercel proxy functions**
  (`api/decks…`) that forward the user's Bearer token server-side (BFF pattern; also enables the httpOnly
  hardening later).
- **Scope:** resource APIs validate the realm JWT signature (per dev-env README), so our `openid profile`
  token is very likely accepted as-is — confirm on the first authenticated call; add a scope only if it 403s.

**Feature tiers (each maps to a Keycloak/API scope):**
- 🟢 **`deck:write`** ✅ shipped — save pool + final deck to your Re:Union account.
- 🟢 **`deck:read`** ✅ shipped — build a cube from one (or several, merged) of your account decks.
- ✅ **`profile` (pseudo)** — display name auto-fills from your Re:Union pseudo at room creation/join
  when logged in (Home, June 2026). **DROPPED from scope (user's call):** draft history, account-based
  cross-device rejoin, authenticated-only rooms — not wanted.
- ❌ **`collection:read` — DROPPED (user's call).** Reading the collection mainly helps with uniques,
  but Re:Union's spirit is "all cards playable regardless of collection," which is exactly the
  draft/sealed ethos. We deliberately keep play collection-agnostic; no owned/not-owned overlay,
  no "draft from my collection."
- ❌ **card-data API — NOT NEEDED for now (user's call).** Our current card source
  (`cards.alteredcore.org`, see #2) is treated as the long-term solution, so we don't need Re:Union
  to ship its own. Card-fetch stays isolated in `cardData.js` so swapping later would be a small
  adapter change if it ever becomes worthwhile.

### 2. Uniques — dying-API dependency REMOVED ✅ (bundling now just an offline hedge)
**✅ Shipped (June 2026):** `fetchUnique` was the last live caller of the retiring
`api.altered.gg` (hit for any non-bundled unique or non-EN locale). Repointed it to
**`cards.alteredcore.org/api/cards?reference=<ref>`** — the durable community API that resolves
**any** unique. New `normalizeAlteredCore` adapter for its JSON shape; `prodImage()` host-swaps
the locked `altered-dev` S3 bucket → public `altered-prod-eu`; CORS verified; bundled EN snapshot
kept as offline/fast path + failure fallback. `api.altered.gg` is no longer referenced anywhere.
So unique-heavy community cubes (CptKawaii's "cube unique", wordcandy70's "Uniques Cube") now
resolve durably, not just our 24.

**Remaining (optional, no deadline):** bundle MORE unique images locally as a resilience/perf
hedge. Only 24 are bundled (`src/lib/uniquesData.js` `UNIQUES_EN` + `public/uniques/<ref>.jpg`);
everything else now loads live from `cards.alteredcore.org` (data) + the prod S3 bucket (art).
- **⚠️ Why this is the residual risk — `altered-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com` is Equinox's OWN
  production image bucket** (same company/infra as the retiring `api.altered.gg`), NOT the community
  `cards.alteredcore.org`. So: card **data** is community-rebuilt and durable, but card **art** still
  comes from Equinox infra that isn't guaranteed to outlive the API. If that bucket ever goes dark,
  images break (data stays fine). Hence snapshotting art locally is the only Equinox dependency left
  to neutralise — opportunistic, prioritise refs people actually paste. Needs Node (run on macOS).

**New durable data source (tested June 2026):** `api.altered.gg` is being retired, but the
community site **`cards.alteredcore.org`** serves the same data and should outlive it.
- **Endpoint:** `https://cards.alteredcore.org/api/cards?reference=<REF>` (Symfony / API
  Platform; no auth). Returns `{ member: [<card>], totalItems }`. The single-id path
  (`/api/cards/<ref>`) 500s — always use the `?reference=` filter.
- **Verified:** all 24 bundled uniques **+** an arbitrary new ref (`ALT_CORE_B_AX_16_U_5075`)
  resolve with full data, and `faction.code` matches our hardcoded factions exactly — including
  every out-of-faction case (e.g. `..._AX_16_U_...` → Bravos, `..._BR_19_...` → Lyra). So this
  source can snapshot **any** unique, not just our 24, even after the old API dies.
- **Different JSON shape** than the old API (needs its own adapter, NOT `normalizeCard`):
  `name` / `imagePath` / `cardType.name` are **per-locale objects** (use `.en`); faction is
  `faction.code` + `faction.name`; `rarity.reference`; `cardType.reference`; and **flat integer**
  `mainCost` / `recallCost` / `forestPower` / `mountainPower` / `oceanPower` (no `#...#` markers).
- **⚠️ Image gotcha:** the API's `imagePath.en` points at the **locked** `altered-dev.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com`
  bucket (403 AccessDenied, even with UA/referer). The **same file is public on the prod bucket** —
  swap the host to **`altered-prod-eu.s3.amazonaws.com`** (path + filename hash identical) → 200
  JPEG. (The old `api.altered.gg` also still returns the prod URL directly while it's up.)

**Action (snapshot script, when refs are in hand — no code yet):** for each unique ref, GET
`cards.alteredcore.org/api/cards?reference=<ref>`, map the fields above into a `UNIQUES_EN`
entry, and download the art from the **prod**-bucket URL (host-swap the returned `imagePath.en`)
to `public/uniques/<ref>.jpg`. Commit the script this time (the original wasn't committed).
Prioritise refs from the community cubes people are actually pasting. Needs Node → run on macOS
(not on PATH on Windows).
- **Urgency reassessed:** card **data** is now future-proofed by `cards.alteredcore.org`, so this
  is no longer a hard deadline for metadata. **Art still depends on the prod S3 bucket staying
  public** — so grabbing images sooner is the remaining time-sensitive part. May later be
  superseded if Re:Union ships its own card-data + image API (1🔴), but that's not guaranteed.
- Possible enhancement: accept a pasted list of unique refs and snapshot them on demand.

### 3. Import Marcus' cube (data-only) — LOWER PRIORITY (user's call), blocked on the full card list
A cube by a game designer (MarcusK, engaged on Discord). Add it the manual way, like LuigiNico's.
**Deprioritised — may pick up later** (was "active"); still blocked on the author's full list anyway.
- **Blocker:** the current list is **missing a few cards** — author is completing it. Don't
  finalise `refs[]`/`cardCount` until the full list lands.
- Add an object to `COMMUNITY_CUBES` in `src/lib/cubes.js` (`id, name, author, description,
  cardCount, refs[]`, plus `heroDraft`/`heroes`/`booster`/`maxPlayers` if it applies).
- Convert official identifiers (e.g. `BTG-131-U-894`) to internal refs
  `ALT_<SET>_B_<FAC>_<n>_<rarity>`. Out-of-faction cards use their real `_R2` ref (see the OOF
  note in `CLAUDE.md`); uniques stay as-is.
- If it has uniques, bundle them (see #2 — same script) while the API is up.
- Add a `booster` recipe (`{ commons, rares, uniques }`) if the rarity mix can't use the classic
  split — see `generateCubeRecipePacks` in `src/lib/packGenerator.js`.
- **Heroes:** has 12 heroes → set `heroDraft: true` + `heroes:[…12 refs]`; the in-app hero draft
  (shipped) handles it. Cap `maxPlayers` to what the pool supports (LuigiNico = 4 because 192 = 4×4×12).
- Source CSV parsed so far: 12 heroes + 367 cards across **all 6 factions** (Ordis + Yzmir
  included, no faction relabel needed); rarities C / R / O (off-faction) / U. Uncertain entries
  still need author input or substitution (no live API): `Halua (unique ?)`, `Nike Unique à 6`,
  `Spotter Unique`, `Jumper R ?`, `Sakarabru?`, blank-rarity `Wingsuit Jumper` — plus the
  not-yet-listed missing cards.

## Planned

### From live testing (17 Jun 2026) — mostly SHIPPED
Backlog captured after the user tried the deployed app; the batch was built the same day.

- **✅ Bug — top-nav wordmark sent in-room users to room creation.** `TopNav` now uses
  `useParams`: inside a room the wordmark links to that room's lobby instead of `/`.
- **✅ Free hero choice (all heroes available).** A single **Heroes** control in the lobby (radio:
  **In packs** | **Free choice**, replacing the two overlapping checkboxes) drives `heroMode` →
  `includeHeroes`/`config.freeHero`. Free choice keeps heroes out of all packs/boosters (every mode,
  draft + sealed); the player picks any hero from the full roster at deckbuild via `HeroPicker`
  (Results + Sealed Deck tab). `packHeroes = includeHeroes && !freeHero` gates pack generation; cube
  hero-draft / sealed slot-0 / custom-cube hero folding are all skipped when on.
- **✅ Cube of the Month spotlight — live with "All Commons".** `SPOTLIGHT` in `cubes.js` points at
  the `all-commons` cube (192 commons, exactly 32 per faction, 12 heroes snake-drafted); banner atop
  the Cubes tab features it. Swap `SPOTLIGHT.cubeId`/`blurb` to rotate next month. Hero names were
  resolved to refs via `cards.alteredcore.org`; `ALT_COREKS_B_BR_03_C` stays OUT (it's Basira, a hero,
  already in the 12).
- **✅ Promo/alt-art cards in cubes.** `cardData.needsCardApi(ref)` (uniques + any non-booster print)
  now drives the cube "extra fetch" everywhere (Lobby draft+sealed, Draft, Sealed, Results,
  CubePreviewModal), so promo-ONLY cards with no booster print resolve from the cards API — e.g.
  "Sofia, First Outpost" (`ALT_BISE_P_BR_64_C`), the 32nd Bravos common in All Commons.
- **✅ Export/Save menu harmonized.** Parallel verb-noun labels (Copy/Save your pulls · your deck)
  with a count on every row.
- **◑ Graphic polish — first pass done.** Light-mode page background deepened so panels separate;
  more look-and-feel work (card grids, spacing, iconography) can continue once eyeballed.
- **◑ Menu improvements — Help + Feedback added.** `TopNav` now has a Help modal (`HelpModal`) and
  a gated Feedback link. **Remaining: provide the Feedback form URL** (`FEEDBACK_URL` in
  `src/lib/links.js`, currently empty → item hidden).
- **✅ Menu font matched to Altered Core.** AC's title font is the commercial **Tiller**; used
  **Fraunces** (closest free Google match) as `font-display`. Swap in real Tiller if licensed.
- **✅ Harden code for Re:Union — robustness pass done.** decks client: clearer 401/403 ("session
  expired") errors, empty-save guard, name trimmed to 150 chars, `toDeckCards` drops non-`ALT_`
  refs and clamps qty 1–99 per the live OpenAPI. **Still deferred (bigger):** move refresh token to
  an httpOnly cookie; open-sourcing under Altered-Community.

### ✅ Fix: heroes in built-in cube sealed — SHIPPED (verified not happening)
Hero-draft cubes (LuigiNico, All Sets, All Commons) used to deal **zero heroes** in sealed.
Resolved by `dealHeroSlots` (`src/lib/packGenerator.js`): each sealed booster gets a hero in
slot 0 drawn (with repetition) from `cube.heroes`, for both recipe and non-recipe cubes, with the
hero sets loaded so they render in `Sealed.jsx`. Confirmed live (Jun 2026). With **Free hero
choice** on, slot-0 heroes are skipped (you free-pick at deckbuild instead).

### Security hardening — httpOnly refresh-token cookie (TRACKED, user's call)
Move the Re:Union **refresh token** out of `sessionStorage` (JS-readable → XSS-exposed) into an
**httpOnly, Secure cookie** set by the Vercel function — a proper BFF pattern. Reshapes
`api/token.js` + `reunion.js` token handling; the proxy architecture already supports it.
Self-contained, in our control, and the **prerequisite for open-sourcing** (below) and any wider
launch. The one genuine security debt in the auth flow.

### Open-source under Altered-Community — when ready (user confirmed)
The Re:Union dev offered to host the project open-source (with a license) on the official
[Altered-Community](https://github.com/Altered-Community) GitHub org. **Move when ready** — after the
integration is solid and the httpOnly hardening above. Before any public push: (1) choose a license,
(2) **scan the full git history to confirm no secret was ever committed** (the Supabase
publishable/anon key is fine; verify no secret key, no `.env`, no Keycloak secret).

### LuigiNico's newest cube (set 1–5) — PARKED by choice
Author shared a now-public [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1a3ZZ2AzzPp05rWJq9Mzt6torBro4noEC74Pn27KXxX0/edit?gid=0)
with tag-column notes, but it's **missing some uniques** ("add any six you feel like") and a bit
out of date. **Parked until set 6 is playable on BGA** (user's call). This is a DIFFERENT, newer
cube than the LuigiNico cube already in the app.

## Recently shipped

- **Cube sealed booster labels fixed** (June 2026). Cube sealed packs are multiset, but the
  booster header labeled each by its first card's set (e.g. "Booster 2 · Skybound Odyssey 1/1").
  Now cube rooms (built-in or pasted) show the cube name, no set icon/ordinal; Multi-Set/Chaos
  sealed (genuinely single-set) unchanged. (`src/pages/Sealed.jsx`)
- **Usage monitoring** (June 2026). `draft_rooms` self-purges hourly (pg_cron `cleanup-old-rooms`,
  >24h), so a `room_stats(day, rooms_created)` table is tallied by the cron BEFORE the delete for
  permanent history. Snapshot + history queries documented in `supabase-monitoring.sql`.
- **Personal cubes via paste**. NO accounts / storage. Cubes tab "＋ Paste your own cube" panel
  (name + `<qty> <REF>` decklist). `parseDecklist` (`src/lib/cubeParser.js`) → refs with
  quantities (refs-only). On Parse: refs resolved against set data + bundled uniques, **heroes
  auto-detected** and split out, duplicates kept, **unresolved refs surfaced** (callout) and
  skipped. Carried inline as `config.customCube = { name, cards:[refs], heroes:[refs] }`, synced
  via Realtime. **Draft:** `generateCubeDraftPacks` on the non-hero multiset; heroes use the
  shared-pool snake draft when `uniqueHeroes ≥ players`, else fold into packs. **Sealed:** heroes
  stay in pool, 7 multiset boosters/player. Player cap auto-derived. Mutually exclusive with
  built-in cube selection. `Draft.jsx`/`Results.jsx`/`Sealed.jsx` resolve uniques from `customCube`.
- **Merged "Multi-Set" draft tab**. Advanced + Chaos → ONE draft tab with "All players receive the
  same packs" (default ON, `config.equalPacks`). One per-set selector (`MultiSetSelector.jsx`);
  required total follows the toggle: **ON → per-player, sum = 4**; **OFF → whole bag, sum =
  players × 4**. Both deal single-set boosters: ON → `generateStructuredPacks` (same set per round
  for all seats); OFF → `generateChaosPacks` (shuffled bag). Stored as `config.multiSetMix` +
  `config.equalPacks`. DRAFT only — sealed keeps its Advanced tab. Removed `ChaosSelector.jsx` +
  `config.chaosMix`.
- **In-app hero draft**. For `heroDraft` cubes, heroes are snake-drafted from ONE shared pool
  (`cube.heroes`): one hero per player after each card round, until each has `min(3,
  floor(pool/players))` → 3 at 2–4 players, 2 at 5–6. `applyPick` pauses into `heroDraft` after
  each round; `applyHeroPick` resumes. Drafted heroes merge into each seat's Results pool.
  `Draft.jsx` phase-aware. Used by LuigiNico (12 heroes, maxPlayers 4) and the All Sets cube
  (12 heroes, 324 cards, maxPlayers 6).

## Candidate / backlog (ideas from other drafting sites)
- **Draft log & replay** — record each seat's picks *and* passes; review after the draft.
- **Cube analytics** — extend `CubePreviewModal` with curve / faction-balance / rarity stats.
- Lower priority: Grid draft, Rochester, Rotisserie alternate formats.

## Waiting on assets
- FUGUE logo, Exalted gem (currently fall back to text / reuse the rare gem).

## Dropped (do not implement)
- **Homegrown accounts / login / user database** — still dropped. We do NOT build our own auth.
  NOTE: integrating with **Re:Union's official Keycloak OIDC** is a different thing and IS in scope
  (Now #1) — identity, DB and auth live on Re:Union's side; we only hold the client secret in a
  Vercel env var and call their API with the user's token. Personal cube *sharing* stays paste-based.
- Bot players; asymmetric pack distribution (superseded by Multi-Set/Chaos); spectator mode; card
  flagging (built then reverted — not wanted).
